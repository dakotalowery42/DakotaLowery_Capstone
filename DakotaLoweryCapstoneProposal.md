Project Name: CDM Smith GIS Project Proposal App

## Project Overview

What are the major features of your web application? What problem is it attempting to solve? What libraries or frameworks will you use?

The major feature of my web application will be to design a web interface for proposals to demonstrate the capabilites of the GIS Team at the company I currently work for (CDM Smith). Other features I will use will be to implent the API from ArcGIS Online to display web mapping applications that we have developed, give a description of the project, and finally use google js charts to display a gantt chart to display the timeline for the project. I will use Django, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the API framework to accomplish this project. 

## Functionality

Walk through the application from the user's perspective. What will they see on each page? What can they input and click and see? How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?
The user will land on a page that displays the proposals description, an embeded web mapping application which will allow the user to view the full functionality of the web mapping application within the web page. The user will also be able to view a Gantt chart that breaks down the process of creating the web mapping application.

## Data Model

What data will you need to store as part of your application? These should be specific nouns, collections of information that serve a collective purpose. Examples might be 'User', 'Book', 'ImageSet'.

## Schedule

Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. State specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.
