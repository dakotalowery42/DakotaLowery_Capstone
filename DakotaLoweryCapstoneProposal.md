Project Name: CDM Smith GIS Project Proposal App

## Project Overview

The major feature of my web application will be to design a web interface for proposals to demonstrate the capabilites of the GIS Team at the company I currently work for (CDM Smith). Other features I will use will be to implent the API from ArcGIS Online to display web mapping applications that we have developed, give a description of the project, and finally use google js charts to display a gantt chart to display the timeline for the project. I will use Django, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the API framework to accomplish this project. 

## Functionality

Ideally the user will land on a Django form which will have three inputs: a descirption which will be a text input, a url which allows the user to put the url of the web mapping application they would like to display, and finally gantt chart inputs such as start task, intermediate tasks, end tasks and dates which the tasks were completed. Upon submitting the form the user will then land on a page that displays the proposals description that they typed up, an embeded web mapping application which will allow the user to view the full functionality of the web mapping application within the web page, and the gantt chartt the user generated that breaks down the process of creating the web mapping application.

## Data Model

I will need a User, a Description (charcter text field), a Map (url), and a Gantt Chart (Google JS Chart). These will be the the models that I will be using to help make the application run.
